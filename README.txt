PROJECT MILESTONE 1
For my project, I am interpreting holiday data collected from HolidayAPI.com. 
So far, I have linked the API and inputted my API key, hence, I can now access the data. 
I will be comparing the data of the US, Mexico and Canada, as they are all on the North American continent. 
Then I will also compare the data of US to some European countries, to see who has more holidays in the month of February for example. 
The HolidayAPI has lots of parameters to use, such as month and day as well. 
With the free version of this database, I can only compare up to 10 countries at a time and can only access 2020 data , which is limiting, but I can work with it to draw some conclusions regardless.

I am having issues writing the data to a CSV file, and have reached out for help...I created the file no problem in the code, but I can not get the data I want (2020 US, MX, CA data) to pull into the list for some reason. For purposes of getting it done, I tried copying the output and pasted it into the write csv function, but I know that's not the right or pretty way to do it. It didn't work either. Not sure how to fix this...

PROJECT MILESTONE 2
12/5 - Was finally able to get the data to write to a csv. I had been trying to write the data to a csv before converting it to a dataframe, which obviously doesn't work. I used json.normalize to create the rows and columns needed, and then wrote it to a csv file.

- Determine measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (variance/std deviation) for 3 selected variables - one qualitative variable and one quantitative variable
- Three questions for your analysis to answer & how the code got you to these answers
- Two questions answered using graphs
- One example using group by
